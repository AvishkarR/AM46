What is DFS..?

Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
One starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible
along each branch before backtracking.
The time and space analysis of DFS differs according to its application area. In theoretical computer science, DFS is typically 
used to traverse an entire graph, and takes time Î˜(|V| + |E|),[4] linear in the size of the graph.
In these applications it also uses space O(|V|) in the worst case to store the stack of vertices on the current search path 
as well as the set of already-visited vertices
